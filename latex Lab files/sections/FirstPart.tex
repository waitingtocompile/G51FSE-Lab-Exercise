\section{First Member}
This is the section dedicated to one of the team members, and it should be written individually . It can include a range of things; first subsection is a space for you to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the module, including complaints about the module coordinator Max Wilson. The second section should have a selfie image with Max! The last part of it is the most important one. You will need to write a paragraph about what you have learned in this module. You can write it in \textbf{Bold} if you want or you can use other fonts. 

Please do not forget:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First paragraph should have your comments about the module
	\item Second one, a selfie img with Max
	\item Last one, what you learned in this module.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments about the module}
Largely I was very happy with the teaching of the module, it was kept engaging and content was well explained. The slides and lecture material was very easy to understand. The puns are terrible though.

\subsection{Selfie with Max}

I couldn't be bothered to get a selfie so here is a picture of a frog

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{A sad frog}

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{photo-thumb-23192.jpg}
\label{fig:selfie}
\end{figure}

You can then use the label of the figure to reference it later with the command ${\backslash}ref$. you can comment out the next line to see an example of how it works.

My 'selfie' with 'Max' is in  Figure~\ref{fig:selfie}.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
I've learned about researching and building a spec, using it to build a complete plan for a system and the ideas behind unit testing. I especially value understanding of good system design, particularly the focus of good research and maintainability.
