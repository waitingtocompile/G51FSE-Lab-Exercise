\subsection{Comments about the module}
I think that the module was enthusiastically taught with lots of emphasis on why good software engineering is important. I really enjoyed the group work, however I do feel that some of the labs were too short for the tasks. The last part of the coursework I really enjoyed as it gave me the chance to work at a better pace. 

\subsection{Selfie with Max}

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
During this module I have learned lots about how to work in a software engineering team. I've learned that even if a task is easy individually it can become harder when you factor in team dynamics. I feel that our team worked well together and this allowed us to learn more about the SE process.
