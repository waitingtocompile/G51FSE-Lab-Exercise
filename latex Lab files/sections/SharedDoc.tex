\subsection{Table of Contributors}


If you want to move a table around you will need to put some parameters in square brackets, if you want it exactly where it is positioned in the text editor just uncomment the [h] below, just after begin{table}

This is the table of contributors (Table~\ref{authors}):
\begin{table}%[h]
