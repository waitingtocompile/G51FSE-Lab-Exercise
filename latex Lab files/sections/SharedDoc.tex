\section{Shared Part}

This could be the Shared Part of the document. It is designed to be written by all members of the team.

Each member should ideally write their details in the table of contributors in the Shared Part of the document.



\subsection{Comments from the second student}
This is the first subsection. Do not forget to include the best parts about the module as well as what you did not like about Max Wilson during the term.

\subsection{Comments from the third student}
I enjoyed the module, even though the topic can be a little boring. It was taught in an interesting way, emphasising the importance of good SE practices. I also hated the fire alarm test :/

\subsection{Comments from the forth student}
This is the first subsection. Do not forget to include the best parts about the module as well as what you did not like about Max Wilson during the term.

\subsection{Table of Contributors}


If you want to move a table around you will need to put some parameters in square brackets, if you want it exactly where it is positioned in the text editor just uncomment the [h] below, just after begin{table}

This is the table of contributors (Table~\ref{authors}):
\begin{table}%[h]
\centering
\caption{People in the Group}
\label{authors}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Name} & \textbf{ID} \\
\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
