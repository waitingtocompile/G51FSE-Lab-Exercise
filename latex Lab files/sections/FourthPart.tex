\section{Fourth Member}
This is the section dedicated to one of the team members, and it should be written individually . It can include a range of things; first subsection is a space for you to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the module, including complaints about the module coordinator Max Wilson. The second section should have a selfie image with Max! The last part of it is the most important one. You will need to write a paragraph about what you have learned in this module. You can write it in \textbf{Bold} if you want or you can use other fonts. 

Please do not forget:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First paragraph should have your comments about the module
	\item Second one, a selfie img with Max
	\item Last one, what you learned in this module.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments about the module}
I enjoyed doing the lab exercises which improved the work that I produced in them, although they were a bit too time pressured. The module was interesting and I didn't find it hard to pay attention during lectures.

\subsection{Selfie with Max}

To include an image, you will need to remove the comments from the code below, place an image in the main folder, and do not forget to put the name of the image instead of ImgName. 

%\begin{figure}[h]
%\caption{Selfie with Max}
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{ImgName}
%\label{fig:selfie}
%\end{figure}

You can then use the label of the figure to reference it later with the command ${\backslash}ref$. you can comment out the next line to see an example of how it works.

% My selfie with Max is in  Figure~\ref{fig:selfie}.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
This module has taught me a lot about the importance of proper planning and testing, before doing this module I didn't know how much doing things later stage can cost. I also learned effective ways of of planning and how to make sure that all the requirements of the software are clearly outlined and therefore met in the finished product.
