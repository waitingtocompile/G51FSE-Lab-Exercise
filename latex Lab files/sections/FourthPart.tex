\subsection{Comments about the module}
I enjoyed doing the lab exercises which improved the work that I produced in them, although they were a bit too time pressured. The module was interesting and I didn't find it hard to pay attention during lectures.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
This module has taught me a lot about the importance of proper planning and testing, before doing this module I didn't know how much doing things later stage can cost. I also learned effective ways of of planning and how to make sure that all the requirements of the software are clearly outlined and therefore met in the finished product.
